Parking Spot Detector using Computer Vision

Overview
This Python project employs computer vision techniques to detect and monitor parking spots in a given video. The system provides real-time feedback on the availability of parking spaces, utilizing image processing and analysis.

Technologies Used
OpenCV: A powerful library for computer vision tasks, used for image processing and feature detection.
NumPy: Essential for numerical operations and array manipulations in Python.
Matplotlib: Used for visualizing image data and displaying results.
Python: The programming language driving the project.
Features
Spot Detection: Utilizes a pre-defined mask to identify parking spots in the video.
Frame Comparison: Calculates absolute differences between frames to determine changes in spot occupancy.
Real-time Feedback: Provides instant updates on the availability of parking spots through color-coded rectangles.
